Advanced image data processing methods. Utilizing transfer learning and fine-tuning models to perform well on data from a different domain. Explaining and visualizing the decision making of a convolutional model through class activation mapping (CAM). Reading and applying knowledge from research papers.\nIntroduction My thesis involved investigating and building a simpler convolutional model for recognising Christian saints in renaissance artworks by the most distinct visual features from their respective iconography. Such features could be the arrows piercing Saint Sebastian, the ointment jar of Mary Magdalene or the lion accompanying Saint Jerome. This was to find a baseline for the aforementioned task and investigate how complex/deep such a model needed to be to base its decision on the iconography of the saint.\n Examples of the data   A link to my thesis is at the top of this page.\nThe model The model chosen was a VGG-16, pretrained on the ImageNet data set. I fine-tuned it on the ArtDL data set (data set of the Christian saints) with 3 different training strategies of varying data pre-processing techniques and different choices of frozen layers. In addition I modified the model to be fully convolutional and generate class activation mappings showing heatmaps of the features used for inference. The most successful strategy involved freezing the input layer, the first convolutional block and half of the second, together with image normalization, random erasing augmentation and expansion of the data to minimize class imbalance.\nResults The final macro averages of the model results were:\n   Precision Recall F1     0.61 0.25 0.31    The precision was rather high for a baseline model, but the low recall and further investigation showed bias towards Virgin Mary, the class with significantly more data than the rest. This was mainly due to the relatively shallow depth of the model compared to the state-of-art, a ResNet50. The investigation showed that a model of only 16 layers of depth isn\u0026rsquo;t deep enough for more abstract features such as the entirety of Mary Magdalene\u0026rsquo;s ointment jar. Further investigation showed that in many cases the baseline model extracted similar features or parts of more abstract features used by the state-of-art model. Example is nudity textures together with arrow lines, versus the specific arrow penetration areas for Saint Sebastian, or the texture of Mary Magdalene\u0026rsquo;s curly hair and lines of the ointment jar, versus specifically the ointment jar.\n CAMs from the VGG-16 model (1)    CAMs from the VGG-16 model (2)   ","date":1611878400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1611878400,"objectID":"5ec7462a205ac475b3716bc3f67e42ef","permalink":"http://christophermadsen.github.io/project/thesis/","publishdate":"2021-01-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/thesis/","section":"project","summary":"An explainable deep learning baseline for iconography research in artworks","tags":["Deep Learning","Data Science","Explainable AI","Transfer Learning"],"title":"Bachelor Thesis","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Key Takeaways This project taught me advanced data processing techniques, how to work with neural networks in practice, the Keras deep learning framework and how to work Agile within a team.\nIntroduction This was my 2nd year project on my BSc edducation and was offered to my team by a PhD student at the Amsterdam Medical Center (AMC). Our team of 5 worked intensively on the project over the course of 1 month and in parallel were also trained to work in the agile framework Scrum.\nShort Summary We took on the task of finding patterns in electrocardiograms (ECG) for prediction of abnormalities such as Atrial Fibrillation. We applied various data processing techniques including but not limited to Discrete Fourier Transform and Savitzky-Golay smoothing. The final model consisted of a fully connected Neural Network which was capable of predicting Atrial Fibrillation with high accuracy. The project was a success and part of the team went on to work further with the PhD student which resulted in the improved project being published in a journal.\nLinks to the slides and the paper are at the top of this page.\nThe Project We received a large set of tagged (specific heart diseases) ECG data. This set contained the ECGs of 1ÃÉ500 people, each divided in 8 channels consisting of 5000 data points each.\nOur client was a PhD (medicine) student working for the AMC. She (and her colleagues) had been tagging the ECGs and were seeking help from competent AI students to perform deep learning on their data.\n   Example data        Healthy sinus rhytm      Aarhytmia       The goal of the 4 week project was to explore feature extraction methods (in signal processing) and to train a Neural Network that would have an accuracy of at least 70% in predicting the tagged heart diseases in the data.\nPreprocessing With Savitzky-Golay smoothing we reduced the noise in the ECGs.\n Noisey signal and smoothed signal   With Fourier Analysis we corrected for baseline wandering in the ECGs.\n   Baseline Wandering        Detecting a wandering baseline      Correcting the baseline       We extracted the pulses from the ECGs and scaled them to a fixed size.

The project was a success and we were satisfied.\n","date":1527811200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1527811200,"objectID":"5ae3b0b8e37c66f54407840ac4a6e7bc","permalink":"http://christophermadsen.github.io/project/amc-afib/","publishdate":"2018-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/amc-afib/","section":"project","summary":"Deep Learning approach to predicting Atrial Fibrillation in patient ECG Data","tags":["Deep Learning","Data Science"],"title":"Prediction of Atrial Fibrillation","type":"project"}]
